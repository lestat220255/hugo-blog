**A halfway out of the road to programming. Love tossing and sharing.**  
**一个半路出家的编程爱好者。喜欢折腾，热爱分享。**  

**Excerpt from The Martian:**  

> At some point, everything is going to go south on you. Everything is going to go south and you're going to say, "This is it. "This is how I end." Now, you can either accept that or you can get to work. That's all it is. You just begin. You do the math. You solve one problem then you solve the next one. And then the next. And if you solve enough problems, you get to come home.
